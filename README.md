# Shell-alike-app
Shell-alike app in C that behaves like the Ubuntu terminal

This shell-alike app can be open using the terminal. It behaves like the Ubuntu terminal, with different commands, some of which are internally implemented.
I implemented from scratch the following commands: ls (with -l, -s, -a and -F parameters), dirname and tac (with -b parameter). 
The programme also supports redirection in the commands, as well as append.
